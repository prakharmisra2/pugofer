This is the README for the [[https://github.com/pugofer/][Pugofer project]] which contains the interpreter =pug=.
It contains:
- The sources for the executable =pug= including install instructions
- Techreports
- editor modes (currently emacs, vscode)
* The Name
- Pugofer = Platonic Universe that's GOod for Equational Reasoning :: The ideas, philosophy, methodology, habits, culture that we believe should be the foundation of good programming education
- Pug = Platonic Universe for Geeks :: The executable that's its most standard interface.

The prelude [[file:./langlevels/pup.pre][pug]] is particularly neat for those who feel the need to grok Hindley-Milner before getting into typeclasses. With that you'll get, for example:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
? :t (+)
(+) : Int -> Int -> Int
? :t (==)
(==) : a -> a -> Bool
#+END_SRC
* Syntax late-bound
You can switch back to classic Haskell syntax with =:s -S=
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
? map.(1+).[1,2,3]
[2, 3, 4] : [Int]

? :s -S
? map (1+) [1,2,3]
[2, 3, 4] :: [Int]

#+END_SRC
* Building
- =cd src=
- Choose the architecture near line 25 following  [[file:src/prelude.h][prelude.h]]

  Exactly one =LINUX=, =WIN32= or =NETBSD= (for MacOS) should be 1; all the rest should be 0
- If necessary, choose C compiler -- =CC= -- in [[file:src/Makefile][Makefile]] 
- =$ make= 
There is no configure to run.\\
Windows seems to build with mingw for 32 bit but not 64.
* Literature
Justifications for these changes are explained in [[http://www.the-magus.in/Publications/notation.pdf][Notes on Notation]]
